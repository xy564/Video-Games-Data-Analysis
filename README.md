# Video-Games-Data-Analysis
This is an #tidytuesday event that I participated in in order to strengthen my understanding for using Git and R in doing data science. 
In this project, I chose a dataset called “Video games and sliced” (2021-03-16) which provides data such as profit gain/loss and number of players for over 80 thousand of video games.
I believe this is an interesting dataset since I’m always a fan for video games.
The data comes from https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2021/2021-03-16/readme.md.
An Rmarkdown file which recorded my analysis workflow and the corresponding rendered html file can be found here.

I first performed a series of data cleaning procedures and data reformatting within R. 
Then, I checked descriptive statistics for several important variables associated with each game such as number of player online and gains/loss compared with previous month. 
I also performed a series of data manipulation to specifically focus on my favorite data – Dota.
I made visuals to characterize change of its popularity among these years and also made a regression analysis to characterize associations between game popularity and game net gains.
